# Storybook Notes

## Setup with Next.JS and Typescript

- Please see: https://github.com/storybookjs/presets/tree/master/packages/preset-typescript
- It is possible to share the webpack config from your Next.js app, but as set up, it requires a separate one

## Roadmap

- Convert main, preview, etc - to use TS
- Wrap global \_app providers to unify
